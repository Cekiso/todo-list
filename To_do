How to make a to-do list CV-worthy 

If you do a to-do list, add at least 2–3 upgrades:

✅ Save tasks to a file (JSON / CSV)
✅ Mark tasks as done / pending
✅ Due dates & priority levels
✅ Command-line menu or simple GUI
✅ Object-oriented design (Task, ToDoList classes)

That turns it from basic → interesting.
